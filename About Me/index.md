Hello, my name is **Jason Victor** and I am from Miami, FL.  
I decided to change my career path to the the IT field and went for a **Cloud Support Engineer program** at Miami Dade College and graduated in 2019.

I'm an **AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified**. Soon I want to become an **AWS Solutions Architect.**

I consider myself an accomplished Engineer, **passionate learner**, well-versed in achieving and exceeding goals through **management and strategy development.**

I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow as a professional.
