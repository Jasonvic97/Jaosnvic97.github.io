Hello, my name is **Esteban Oliva** and I am originally from Cuba. I graduated in *Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC Machinist)** and **Associate's degree** in **Industrial and Product Design** in the **Salesians de Sarria**, from 2010 to 2013.  

Soon I will be getting my solutions architect AWS certifications and in 2020 I am planning to start my **Master's Degree in Computer Science**.
