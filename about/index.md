Hello, my name is **Esteban Oliva** and I am originally from Cuba. I studied **Cloud Support Engineer** at Miami Dade College, in Miami and graduated in 2019.
In 2012 I finished my **Master's Degree in Curriculum & Instruction with concentration in ESOL** in Concordia University- Portland, OR. A few years later, I decided to change my career path and went for a **Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering** from Keiser University and graduated in 2017.
Soon I will be getting my Cloud Pactitioner AWS Certifications in 2019.
